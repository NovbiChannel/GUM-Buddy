# PLANNING
<p>Making some time out of your busy schedule to go to the gym every day for a workout seems difficult for working professionals and students alike due to the busyness of work and study. As a result, many people choose to exercise or work out at the gym at home. However, working out in the gym or doing an exercise without proper procedure or position and without the proper guidance of a trainer can damage your muscles. Also, hiring a personal trainer may not fit everyone's budget. So, to solve this problem, I decided to develop an Android-based GYM Buddy application that will act as a virtual trainer. This application will help users to perform various body exercises with step by step positions and images. Users can track daily exercise data. The Gym Buddy app contains a list of all exercises based on different types and categories (eg abs, chest, biceps, etc.). Users can also keep track of how many sets or weights they have used in a given workout to increase or decrease power accordingly. So this gym workout app for android will act as a virtual guide for users and provide easy access to the gym.</p>
